A simple shell written in Ruby because why not!
I'm new to programing and did this in 6 hours. Enjoy

 - Did I fix the color?
 - Sample Text

## How to use

Just run
 `git clone  https://github.com/Stargirl-chan/ruby-shell.git`
 Change into that directory and run `./shell`

Because why not?

**Can I use this as my main shell?**
Are you a masochist?

When I'm bored, yes

**Who asked these questions?**
Well I don't know

**How did you write this?**
These two sites helped me creating it:
[Writing a shell in 25 Lines of Ruby](https://www.rubyguides.com/2016/07/writing-a-shell-in-ruby/)
